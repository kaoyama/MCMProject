      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The localization features of MoneyClip Mobile will provide customers with targeted advertisement, coupons, and loyalty networks that will be an additional feature to an existing web-based payments infrastructure.  Below, the Problem Statement, Functional and Non-Functional Requirements, Environmental Requirements, Potential Risks, and the Project Plan can be found. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Problem and Solution Statement</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>MoneyClip Mobile (MCM) is a web-based payments infrastructure providing fee-free transactions to customers and merchants using through the use of mobile smartphones.  Mr. Joshua Cross of Hermes Commerce, Inc. is planning to make this mobile payment system more robust by providing targeted advertisements, coupons, and managing customerâ€™s royalty programs. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>This capstone project will develop the localization features for the MCM advertisement, coupons, and loyalty network.  The software will be developed for the existing MCM network and database to ease the transition of integration this feature.  The team will be developing the same copy of the existing network and database on a local server to develop in and test the added feature.  The prototype of the localization features implemented on the database, webservice, and iOS/Android applications will be presented to Mr. Cross at the end of this project.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>This section outlines the expectations of the MCM localization feature. Below is a list of the functional requirements of this system.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>I.       iOS/Android Application</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>	A.    User Application</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1.     Pushing advertisements and coupons.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>i.                 The localization feature pushes advertisements and coupons to the user.</p>
            <p>ii.               The localization feature integrates with the database to provide targeted advertisements to the user.</p>
            <p>iii.             Users must be able to opt in to various levels of participation.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>2.     Loyalty programs</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>i.                 Users must be able to access their loyalty programs from the application.</p>
          <p>ii.               Users must be able to modify their settings for loyalty programs.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>II.     Webservice</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>A.    Users</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1.     Users must be able to perform the same tasks that are available in the application.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>B.    Merchants</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1.     Merchants must be able to create new coupons and advertisements.</p>
          <p>2.     Merchants must be able to modify existing coupons and advertisements.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>C.    Administrator</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1.     Administrator must be able to approve new coupons and advertisements.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>III.   Database</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>A.    Administrator</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1.     Administrator must be able to integrate new coupons and advertisements into the existing database.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>2.     The location of the merchants must be integrated into the database.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Environmental Requirements</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The team must use the existing MCM infrastructure, so the transition of adding the localization feature will be seamless.  Thus, a Mac computer will be required for iOS/iPhone programming.  iOS deployment on a physical device requires a subscription to the Apple Developer Network, which costs $99 annually.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Non-Functional Requirements</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Due to MCM having an existing infrastructure, the localization feature must be integrated into the existing system seamlessly.  This includes the existing webservice, iOS application, and the database.  The Android application is yet to be developed for MCM, so the basic skeleton of the iOS application will be used. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Potential Risks</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>1.     The localization feature of the system compromises the security of the existing payments infrastructure of MCM.</p>
      <p>2.     Users have a privacy protection on their geolocation, so targeted ads based on location becomes unfeasible.</p>
      <p>3.     Merchants push too many advertisements to their users using the new feature.</p>
