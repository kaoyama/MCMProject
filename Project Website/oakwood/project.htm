      <p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: System with active RFID tag, assuming this is a programmable tag.  The patient information is pulled from Centrak.  The remaining information on the form is filled out by the user, which is programmed into the tag.  The sample goes inside the container with the RFID attached to it, which is taken to histology, with the information sent to the system of the detailed path and their corresponding times.  Once the sample reaches histology, data is pulled out of the RFID, and the RFID container is then reset to be reprogrammed back in OR for a different sample.</p>
      <p><strong>Figure 2</strong>: System with passive RFID tag, assuming the RFID is non-programmable.  The RFID tag number and information from Centrak, the OR control, is inputted into the pathology requisition form. The user fills in the missing information, and the compiled form is entered into the database (or one associated with our system), which is associated with the RFID number.  The RFID-tagged sample will be transported to histology, where it is reidentified via the system.</p>
